    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text 
        to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it a part of a table?),
        structure a document into logical sections (Does it has a header?, Three columns of content? A navigation menu?),
        and embed content such as images and videos into a page.</p>
        <p>Elements consists of:    
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A tag name </li>
        <li>Required or optional attributes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        It can be easier to understand what is going on in your code if you have it nicely formatted.
        In this HTML each nested element is indented by four spaces more thaqn the one it is sitting inside.
        it is up to you to choose the style of formatting (how many spaces for each level of indentation, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
        In Visual Studio Code, you can automatically format your code by following these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Type ctrl-shift-p (windows) or cmd-shift-p (mac) to open the Command Pallete</li>
        <li>In the Command Palette, type <em>format</em></li>
        <li>From the results, choose <em>Format document</em></li>

    </ol>
